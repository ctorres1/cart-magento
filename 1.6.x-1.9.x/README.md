The products to buy with this payment modality can only be simple products and virtual products.
With this payment method, the customer authorizes MercadoPago to make a frequent payment. 
After that, the customer can cancel, pause or resume a recurring payment.
This functionality can be enabled/disabled from plugin configuration.

**Returns and Cancellations between MercadoPago and Magento**

This feature synchronizes orders between MercadoPago and Magento. 
Returns and cancellations made from Magento are synchronised in MercadoPago and vice versa.
Returns can be enabled/disabled within Magento admin panel.
You can also define the maximum amount of partial refunds on the same order and the maximum amount of days until refund is not accepted by using Magento admin panel.

**Configurable success page**

This feature allows to configure the success page to which Magento redirects the customer once a payment was made with MercadoPago.
Within Magento admin panel, you can select between success page from MercadoPago or standard page from Magento (checkout/success).

**Installments calculator**

This feature allows to add an installment calculator within Magento pages.
It can be enabled/disabled from the Magento admin panel.
The calculator can be visualized within product, cart, or both pages.
The customer can use the installment calculator to see the financing options available and the final amount to be paid.

*Available for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela*

**Split payments in custom checkout**

This feature allows customer to split Custom Checkout payments by using two different cards.
This payment modality behaves in the same way as the equivalent payment mode in the classic checkout.
This functionality can also be enabled/disabled from Magento plugin configuration.

**Debug Mode in custom checkout**

This feature enabled allows testing the plugin without a SSL certificate. 
The custom checkout does not appear as a payment method if you operate over HTTP and with the configuration disabled.
It is not recommended enable this option in production environment.

**Status Update Cron between Magento and MercadoPago**

This feature allows you to check and update the status of Magento orders, depending on your status in Mercadopago.
The updating of the order states is done automatically, 
this functionality aims to automate the cases in which this does not happen.
On store administration you can define the execution period and limit the number of orders to be evaluate using a time window.
